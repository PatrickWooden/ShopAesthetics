### orderhistory.js

*Lines 86*

```
   <StyledButton variant="contained" onClick={handleClick}>Review</StyledButton>

The code above was created by adapting the code in [reactrouter](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/location) as shown below: 

```
{
  key: 'ac3df4', // not with HashHistory!
  pathname: '/somewhere',
  search: '?some=search-string',
  hash: '#howdy',
  state: {
    [userDefined]: true
  }
}

```

- <How> The code in [reactrouter](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/location) was implemented by Patrick Wooden
- <Why> [reactrouter](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/location)'s Code was used because it allowed for me to pass the values of my states to the profile page
- <How> [reactouter](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/location)'s Code was modified by not using the same state values, instead using my own and also only using the state part in the code above

*Repeat as needed*


### profile.js

*Lines 9-10*

```
    const location = useLocation();
  const id = location.state.id;

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [Labs Madisoft](https://labs.madisoft.it/how-does-react-router-location-state-works/) as shown below: 

```
let location = useLocation();
 
location.state; 

```

- <Why> [Labs Madisoft](https://labs.madisoft.it/how-does-react-router-location-state-works/)'s Code was used because It allowed me to access the states I had sent over from the signup page
- <How> [Labs Madisoft](https://labs.madisoft.it/how-does-react-router-location-state-works/)'s Code was modified by adding location.state.whatevernameIsentover to display the info.

### orderhistory.js

*Lines 133-137*

```
  {orders.map((order) => (
          <Grid item xs={12} md={12}>
            <OrderHistoryCard key={order.id} product={order.product} status={order.status} address={order.address} photo={order.photoUrl} />
          </Grid>
        ))}
```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-fetch-data-from-apis-using-asynchronous-await-in-reactjs//) as shown below: 

```
(posts.map((item) =>
                        // Presently we only fetch 
                        // title from the API 
                        <h4>{item.title}</h4>)
                    )
```

- <How> The code in [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-fetch-data-from-apis-using-asynchronous-await-in-reactjs/) was implemented by Patrick Wooden
- <Why> [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-fetch-data-from-apis-using-asynchronous-await-in-reactjs/)'s Code was used because It allows us map through each order and create a card to display them in
- <How> [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-fetch-data-from-apis-using-asynchronous-await-in-reactjs/)'s Code was modified by adding a grid wrap around each item, changing the name of the array that was mapped out and used my own card component I created.

### trackorder.js

*Lines 123-128*

```
  {orders.map((order) => (
          <Grid item xs={12} md={12}>
            <OrderHistoryCard key={order.id} product={order.product} status={order.status} address={order.address} photo={order.photoUrl} />

### favourites.js

*Lines 40-48 and 76-78*

```
  const [anchorEl, setAnchorEl] = useState(null);

  const handleClick = (event) => {
    setAnchorEl(event.currentTarget);
  };

  const handleClose = () => {
    setAnchorEl(null);
  };

-------------------------
 <Menu anchorEl={anchorEl} open={Boolean(anchorEl)} onClose={handleClose}>
              <MenuItem onClick={handleClose}>Remove from Favorites</MenuItem>
            </Menu>

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-menu/) as shown below: 

```
(posts.map((item) =>
                        // Presently we only fetch 
                        // title from the API 
                        <h4>{item.title}</h4>)
                    )
```

- <How> The code in [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-menu/) was implemented by Patrick Wooden
- <Why> [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-menu/)'s Code was used because It allows us to hide more options for each ad on the favourite page, like removing an ad from the favourites list so the page looks cleaner overall.
- <How> [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-menu/)'s Code was modified by only have one menu item and creating that individual one instead of creating a map and looping though multiple options like the website shows

### createreview.js

*Lines 83*

```
<Rating defaultValue={2} precision={0.5} onChange={handleRatingChange}/>


```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-rating/) as shown below: 

```
<Rating name="half-rating" defaultValue={2.5} precision={0.5} />
```

- <How> The code in [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-rating/) was implemented by Patrick Wooden
- <Why> [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-rating/)'s Code was used because it allows us to allow users to enter a star rating with their product when creating a review
- <How> [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-rating/)'s Code was modified by only adding a onchange handler so we are ablet to save the rating the user gives a product and store that in their review data and can be displayed on the sellers profile later.
