### order-history.js

*Lines 54-56 and line 86*

const handleClick = (event) => {
navigate("/createreview", { state: { id: id, product: product, photoUrl: photoUrl } });
};

<StyledButton variant="contained" onClick={handleClick}>Review</StyledButton>

The code above was created by adapting the code in [reactrouter](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/location) as shown below:

```
{
key: 'ac3df4', // not with HashHistory!
pathname: '/somewhere',
search: '?some=search-string',
hash: '#howdy',
state: {
[userDefined]: true
}
}
```

- <How> The code in [reactrouter](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/location) was implemented by Patrick Wooden
- <Why> [reactrouter](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/location)'s Code was used because it allowed for me to pass the values of my states to the profile page
- <How> [reactouter](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/location)'s Code was modified by not using the same state values, instead using my own and also only using the state part in the code above

### order-history.js

*Lines 133-137*

```
{orders.map((order) => (
<Grid item xs={12} md={12}>
<OrderHistoryCard key={order.id} product={order.product} status={order.status} address={order.address} photo={order.photoUrl} />
</Grid>
))}
```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-fetch-data-from-apis-using-asynchronous-await-in-reactjs//) as shown below:

```
(posts.map((item) =>
// Presently we only fetch

- <How> [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-fetch-data-from-apis-using-asynchronous-await-in-reactjs/)'s Code was modified by adding a grid wrap around each item, changing the name of the array that was mapped out and used my own card component I created.

### favourites.js

*Lines 39-47 and 75-77*

```
const [anchorEl, setAnchorEl] = useState(null);

const handleClick = (event) => {
setAnchorEl(event.currentTarget);
};

const handleClose = () => {
setAnchorEl(null);
};

---

 <Menu anchorEl={anchorEl} open={Boolean(anchorEl)} onClose={handleClose}>
  <MenuItem onClick={handleClose}>Remove from Favorites</MenuItem>
</Menu>
```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-menu/) as shown below:

```
import Menu from '@mui/material/Menu';
import MenuItem from '@mui/material/MenuItem';
import MoreVertIcon from '@mui/icons-material/MoreVert';

const options = [
  'None',
  'Atria',
  'Callisto',
  'Dione',
  'Ganymede',
  'Hangouts Call',
  'Luna',
  'Oberon',
  'Phobos',
  'Pyxis',
  'Sedna',
  'Titania',
  'Triton',
  'Umbriel',
];

const ITEM_HEIGHT = 48;

export default function LongMenu() {
  const [anchorEl, setAnchorEl] = React.useState(null);
  const open = Boolean(anchorEl);
  const handleClick = (event) => {
    setAnchorEl(event.currentTarget);
  };
  const handleClose = () => {
    setAnchorEl(null);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <IconButton
        aria-label="more"
        id="long-button"
        aria-controls={open ? 'long-menu' : undefined}
        aria-expanded={open ? 'true' : undefined}
        aria-haspopup="true"
        onClick={handleClick}
      >
        <MoreVertIcon />
      </IconButton>
      <Menu
        id="long-menu"
        MenuListProps={{
          'aria-labelledby': 'long-button',
        }}
        anchorEl={anchorEl}
        open={open}
        onClose={handleClose}
        PaperProps={{
          style: {
            maxHeight: ITEM_HEIGHT * 4.5,
            width: '20ch',
          },
        }}
      >
        {options.map((option) => (
          <MenuItem key={option} selected={option === 'Pyxis'} onClick={handleClose}>
            {option}
          </MenuItem>
        ))}
      </Menu>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- <How> The code in [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-menu/) was implemented by Patrick Wooden
- <Why> [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-menu/)'s Code was used because It allows us to hide more options for each ad on the favourite page, like removing an ad from the favourites list so the page looks cleaner overall.
- <How> [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-menu/)'s Code was modified by only have one menu item and creating that individual one instead of creating a map and looping though multiple options like the website shows. I also do not set a key to each menu item or use the selected={} like they do in the example

*****

### create-review.js

*Lines 68*

```
<Rating defaultValue={2} precision={0.5} onChange={handleRatingChange}/>
```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-rating/) as shown below:

```
<Rating name="half-rating" defaultValue={2.5} precision={0.5} />
```

- <How> The code in [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-rating/) was implemented by Patrick Wooden
- <Why> [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-rating/)'s Code was used because it allows us to allow users to enter a star rating with their product when creating a review
- <How> [mui](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-rating/)'s Code was modified by changing the default value to 1 and making the percision change to 1. This will be further modified in the future by adding a onchange handler so we are able to save the rating the user gives a product and store that in their review data and can be displayed on the sellers profile later. As there is no backend implemented into this project yet this section does not look very modified so I wanted to make this note so markers know that this code will be further modified and not just used like this.

### orders-buyers.js

*Lines 31-56*

```

  {active === 'favourites' && <Favourites />}
  {active === 'payments' && <AccountPayments />}
  {active === 'rating-review' && <RatingAndReviews />}
  {active === 'cart' && <Cart />}
```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [h3webdevtuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGaaw1Py2aY&t=708s&ab_channel=h3webdevtuts) as shown below:

```
<button onClick={() => setActive('FirstCard)}> One</button>

<div>
{active === "FirstCard" && <Card data={Data} cardIndex='0'/>}
```

- <How> The code in [h3webdevtuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGaaw1Py2aY&t=708s&ab_channel=h3webdevtuts) was implemented by Patrick Wooden
- <Why> [h3webdevtuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGaaw1Py2aY&t=708s&ab_channel=h3webdevtuts)'s Code was used because it allowed for all the order page components to be rendered and displayed on the orders page without being moved to another page. I also used this code for making the current page in the orders navbar be a different color to show it is the active link
- <How> [h3webdevtuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGaaw1Py2aY&t=708s&ab_channel=h3webdevtuts)'s Code was modified by placing the onclick handler inside a navlink instead of a button. I also used different names for the states as well as returned pages that were created like orderhistory and did not pass any data into them. I also removed the cardIndex that they had used. I also modified it for the NavLinks by adding a condtional modifier for applying the active_page_navigation styling when active was equal to that page.

### register.js and login.js

*Lines 42-43* for login.js

```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$/;
```

The code above was created by adapting the code is shown below:

```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$/;

I am not able to change the regex because it was used for the form validation in the register and login page

```
Copy and paste the snippet of code you are referencing
<input id='fileUpload' type='file' multiple accept='application/pdf, image/png'/>
